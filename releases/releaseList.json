    "Description": "Initial alpha version released, you can create a single KML file from the Google Earth application (place marker, right click save as) and publish it to the web and just add a straight FQDN (www.yourdomain.com/myPlaceMarker.kml) to your kml file in the control's properties.  I'll be adding a multiple Kml file and geoRSS support later.  Also, if you have problems publishing the Kml file, you will need to add a mime-type to your web server of file extension: .kml mime type: application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml kml",
